I can see there's no point in explaining it by itself, however she was a much needed contributor in the past few weeks and still managed to make the team as a person. They really did have the right people, their expertise and work ethic to deliver great product, with an all-access API to the top.

On a personal level we had a lot of problems with issues as a team, so we had to take measures against them in the new plan â€“ and not every week could see that as a negative.

There may have been times where we would need to reevaluate the team and change their approach. The team may suffer as a result, but we will continue to work with the team to resolve the problem once and for all. For me, the only thing standing in my way is the opportunity to have a constructive dialogue with them and ensure that we are fully supported and represented here. We all will be working hard on making those adjustments.

We also found that despite some positive feedback about the new plan and its approach to the team, it still felt pretty weak in that regard. To be honest there were certainly some challenges there that we really felt didn't make sense to bring things forward as a whole. There was still some important work to be done on how we handle the team, and while the changes are being finalised now, it definitely felt a little over-stretched. To put it bluntly, we all feel very strongly
